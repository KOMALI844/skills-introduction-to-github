🔍 Cybersecurity Scanning Project 

## 📘 Project Overview
This project focuses on identifying open ports, running services, and basic vulnerabilities in target systems or websites using **graphical or terminal-based tools**

 🧰 Tools Used
| Tool       | Description                              |
|------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Zenmap** | GUI for Nmap, used for port scanning     |
| **Nikto**  | Web server vulnerability scanner         |
| **Shodan** | Search engine for internet-connected devices |
| **Wireshark** | Network packet capture and analysis    |

🖥️ Targets Scanned
- Localhost (127.0.0.1)
- Internal Network IP (e.g., `192.168.1.1`)
- TryHackMe Virtual Machines
- Sample vulnerable website: `http://testphp.vulnweb.com`

 🔎 Scans Performed

✅ Zenmap
- Port scan on local network device
- Detected services: SSH, HTTP, HTTPS
- OS fingerprinting enabled

✅ Nikto
- Checked web server for:
  - Outdated Apache versions
  - Directory indexing
  - Default files

✅ Shodan
- Searched exposed devices by location & technology
- Example query: `apache country:"IN"`

✅ Wireshark
- Captured live HTTP packets
- Filtered and analyzed request/response data


📚 Learning Outcome
- Understood scanning methods in cybersecurity
- Used real tools without any programming
- Learned how to detect basic vulnerabilities in networks and websites
